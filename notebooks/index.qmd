Here you'll find various notebooks created by Sparkgeo. Navigate to the notebooks on the left.
To view the source code visit the [github repo](https://github.com/sparkgeo/world_bank_deliverable)

## Installation

First `clone` this repository to your local environment.

To run the notebooks locally you need to install the environments for `R` , `Quarto` and `Python`.

## Python

### Conda or Mamba

To build the environment from a `yml` file using mamba (recommended)

`mamba env create -f environment.yml`

### Usage

Once activating your conda environment:

`conda activate wb-spk-env`
You should be able to run the `.ipynb` notebooks.

For the provided example applications, activate the virtual environment and then run one in this fashion:

```sh
python src/count_cars.py --detection-file data/processed/test_cars.gpkg --intersect-file data/processed/beitbridge_road_mask_v2.gpkg --output-json cars.geojson
```

Please see the Readme in the notebooks directory for their usage.

### R Projects

To replicate the R environment, you can simply `install.packages('renv')` and open up the R Project file and run  `renv::restore() ` to restore the  `renv ` lockfile to load in all the appropriate libraries.

### Usage

Restoring the `renv` above will allow you to run any `.qmd` notebooks.

## Quarto

[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system.

Review [Quarto's Quickstart](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) for installation instructions.

To regenerate outputs from Quarto:

`quarto render hello.ipynb --to html`

`quarto render hello.ipynb --to docx`
